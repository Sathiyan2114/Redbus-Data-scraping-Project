# Data Scraping from Redbus

The objective of this project is to automatically extract and analyze Redbus website bus route data. The goal is to compile extensive information regarding bus services, both public and private, such as route maps, bus kinds, costs, star ratings, and seat availability. This project uses web scraping techniques to create an interactive application that allows users to explore and filter bus service data with ease. The end result is a valuable set of insights.

Key Features

Using Selenium for Web Scraping: This method automates the process of obtaining bus schedules and routes straight from the Redbus website.

MySQL Data Storage: Quick and adaptable data retrieval is made possible by effectively storing the scraped data in a structured MySQL database.

The interactive streamlit application provides an easy-to-use interface for sorting through and evaluating bus service data. Results may be filtered by the user according to bus type, route, price range, star rating, and availability of seats.

Data analysis and visualization: By offering consumers lucid insights via data visualizations, this tool assists them in making well-informed judgments regarding their bus travel alternatives.

Technologies Used

Selenium: For browser automation and web scraping.

MySQL: For reliable and expandable data hosting.

SQLAlchemy: For running SQL queries and maintaining database connections.

Streamlit: To construct an interactive online application that lets users see and filter the information.

Python is the main programming language used for creating applications, manipulating data, and writing scripts.

Project Goals

Automate Data Extraction: Create a dependable and effective technique for obtaining information about bus services from the Redbus website.

Store Data Systematically: To make administration and access easier, arrange the data that has been scraped into a MySQL database.

Build a Streamlit application with an intuitive user interface that enables users to work with the data, apply filters, and derive insights from visualizations.

Offer Useful Insights: Give consumers the ability to examine bus service statistics according to different standards, assisting them in making more informed travel choices.

In order to provide a comprehensive tool for investigating bus services, this project integrates the capabilities of web scraping, data storage, and interactive data presentation. Its accessible and useful design makes it simpler for users to locate the information they want quickly.
